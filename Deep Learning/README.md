# Specializations

This is my progress and assignments on Andrew Ng's Deep learning Specialization on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning). They are in total of 5 topics in different field of Deep Learning. Each field is about  3-4 weeks and at the end of each week, there is a Notebook assignment to complete for you to go on.  Achieving good scores in questions and Notebook assignments you receive a Certification.
